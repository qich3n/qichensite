# Qi Chen — Portfolio

Personal portfolio site built with React.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Customize content

Most content lives in `src/portfolio.js`.

## Custom 404 (GitHub Pages)

- `public/404.html` redirects unknown routes back into the SPA.
- `public/index.html` restores the original path and the app shows a custom 404 screen.

If your site is deployed at the domain root (not `user.github.io/repo`), open `public/404.html` and set `segmentCount = 0`.

## Credits

This project started as a fork of the open-source **developerFolio** template by Saad Pasta. UI branding has been removed/overridden, I’ve added my own touch, and credit is retained here.
